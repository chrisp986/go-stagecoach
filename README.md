## Stagecoach - a mail service written in Go


This project is still in an early development stage and is not ready for testing yet. This project is developed only by me and 
as a side project the progress might be slow since Go is also quite new to me. I am very welcome for any code reviews/suggestions/pull requests. 



### Dependencies

SQLite - Stores events and mail addresses

SQLX - Addition to the database/sql package

Gin - Implementation of REST API
